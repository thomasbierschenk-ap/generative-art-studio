# UI Layout Fixes - October 25, 2025

## Summary of Changes

Fixed the control panel width issue by making multiple adjustments to ensure all LabelFrame borders are visible and the entire control panel fits without scrolling.

## Changes Made

### 1. Window Size
**Increased overall window size:**
- Width: 1400px → **1500px**
- Height: 900px → **1000px**

This provides more vertical space so all controls fit without needing to scroll.

### 2. Left Panel Width
**Increased the fixed left panel width:**
- From: 450px
- To: **480px**

### 3. Scrollable Canvas Width
**Increased the inner scrollable canvas width:**
- From: 400px
- To: **460px**

This was the key fix - the inner canvas was constraining the width of all the LabelFrames.

### 4. Reduced Horizontal Padding
**Reduced padding on all sections to maximize available width:**
- Output Size section: `padx=10` → `padx=5`
- Parameters section: `padx=10` → `padx=5`
- Button frame: `padx=10` → `padx=5`

## Files Modified

- `src/gui/main_window.py`
  - Line ~44: Window geometry changed to 1500x1000
  - Line ~51: Left panel minsize changed to 480
  - Line ~54: Left panel width changed to 480
  - Line ~68: Canvas width changed to 460
  - Line ~80: Output Size padx changed to 5
  - Line ~90: Parameters padx changed to 5
  - Line ~95: Button frame padx changed to 5

## Result

✅ All LabelFrame borders now fully visible
✅ No horizontal scrolling needed
✅ All controls fit within the window height (no vertical scrolling)
✅ Clean, professional appearance

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Start the GUI: `./run_gui.sh` or `python3 src/main.py`
2. Check that all section borders are fully visible on the right side
3. Verify that "Ready" status is visible at the bottom without scrolling
4. Resize the window to ensure layout remains correct

## Before vs After

**Before:**
- Window: 1400x900
- Left panel: 450px
- Inner canvas: 400px
- Padding: 10px
- Result: Borders cut off, vertical scrolling needed

**After:**
- Window: 1500x1000
- Left panel: 480px
- Inner canvas: 460px

- Result: All borders visible, no scrolling needed
