# Pause Button Save Fix - Quick Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-26  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed and Committed

## Problem
Save buttons were greyed out/disabled when pausing generation, preventing users from saving in-progress artwork.

## Solution
Removed unnecessary conditional check in `_on_pause_continue()` method. Save buttons are now **always enabled when paused** since artwork always exists during generation.

## Impact
✅ Users can now save intermediate artwork at any point  
✅ Better workflow for capturing interesting partial generations  
✅ Consistent with the pause/continue feature's purpose  
✅ Status message confirms: "Paused - You can save the current artwork"

## Files Modified
- `src/gui/main_window.py` - Updated `_on_pause_continue()` method
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented the fix
- `PAUSE_BUTTON_FIX.md` - Detailed technical documentation

## Testing
✅ Import test passed  
✅ Code review confirms fix  
✅ Ready for user testing

## Next Steps
1. Test in the GUI by:
   - Starting a generation
   - Clicking "Pause"
   - Verifying save buttons are enabled
   - Saving the in-progress artwork
   - Clicking "Continue" to resume
2. Push changes to GitHub when ready
