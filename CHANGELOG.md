# Changelog

All notable changes to the Generative Art Studio project.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed - Pause Button Save Buttons (2025-10-26)

#### Issue
- Save buttons remained disabled/greyed out when pausing generation
- Users couldn't save in-progress artwork while paused

#### Solution
- Removed conditional check that was preventing save buttons from enabling
- Save buttons now **always enabled when paused** (since artwork always exists during generation)
- Status message confirms: "Paused - You can save the current artwork"

#### Impact
- Users can now save intermediate artwork at any point during generation
- Better workflow for capturing interesting partial generations
- Consistent with the pause/continue feature's purpose

### Added - Pause/Continue Feature (2025-10-26)

#### New Functionality
- **Replaced Abort with Pause/Continue**: More flexible generation control
  - Pause generation at any point without losing progress
  - Save current artwork while paused
  - Resume generation from where it left off
  - Create multiple saved versions from a single generation run
  - Button dynamically changes between "Pause" and "Continue"

#### User Workflow Improvements
- **Save Intermediate States**: Pause to save interesting partial generations
- **Create Variations**: Save at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% completion
- **Layer Mode Compatible**: Pause/save works with layered artwork
- **No Work Lost**: All progress preserved when pausing

#### Technical Implementation
- **Pause State Management**:
  - Added `is_paused` flag for pause state tracking
  - Added `paused_time` to track time spent paused
  - Added `pause_start_time` for current pause timing
- **Smart Time Tracking**:
  - Generation time excludes paused periods
  - Accurate time estimates when resuming
  - Completion message shows actual generation time
- **Thread-Safe Pause Loop**:
  - Generator thread waits in polling loop when paused
  - GUI remains responsive via `update_idletasks()`
  - No complex synchronization needed
- **UI State Management**:
  - Save buttons enabled while paused
  - Save buttons disabled while generating
  - Status messages reflect pause state
  - Progress bar freezes/resumes correctly

#### Benefits
- **More Control**: Stop and examine artwork at any point
- **Multiple Versions**: Create variations from single run
- **Happy Accidents**: Save interesting intermediate states
- **Better Workflow**: Pause to save, then continue adding complexity
- **Layer Friendly**: Works seamlessly with layer mode

#### Documentation
- Created comprehensive `PAUSE_CONTINUE_FEATURE.md`
- Detailed user workflows and examples
- Technical implementation notes
- Future enhancement ideas

### Fixed - User Experience Improvements (2025-10-26)

#### New Feature - Start Angle Parameter
- **Added `start_angle` parameter** to Mathematical Patterns Generator (0-360 degrees)
  - Allows rotation of spiral and Lissajous pattern starting positions
  - Enables more varied compositions and precise pattern orientation
  - Works seamlessly with symmetry parameter
  - Perfect for layering patterns at different angles
  - Default: 0.0 (maintains backward compatibility)

#### Fixed - Save After Abort
- **Save buttons now stay enabled** after aborting generation
  - Previously, save buttons were disabled when aborting incomplete generation
  - Now, if artwork exists, save buttons remain enabled
  - Allows saving interesting partial generations ("happy accidents")
  - Provides more flexibility in the creative process
  - No loss of work when aborting

#### Fixed - Random Walk Wrap Boundary
- **Eliminated straight lines** when using wrap boundary behavior
  - Previously created bizarre horizontal/vertical lines from edge to edge
  - Now breaks path into separate segments when wrapping occurs
  - No visual connection between segments
  - Cleaner, more professional-looking wrap behavior
  - Preserves organic flow of random walk
- **Technical changes**:
  - `_handle_boundary()` now returns wrap detection flag
  - `_generate_walk()` returns list of path segments
  - Segments created automatically when wrap event detected
  - Progress updates handle multiple segments correctly

#### Documentation
- Created comprehensive `FIXES_2025-10-26.md` documenting all three improvements
- Updated CHANGELOG with detailed fix descriptions
- All changes maintain backward compatibility

### Enhanced - Mathematical Patterns Generator (2025-10-26)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Lissajous straight lines**: Changed `closed=False` to prevent unwanted line connecting end to start
- **Improved visual quality**: Patterns now look more natural and less "computer-generated"

#### New Parameters - Color System
- **color_scheme** (replaces use_gradient): 6 color schemes
  - `gradient`: Smooth hue transition (default)
  - `monochrome`: Brightness variation only
  - `complementary`: Alternates between base and opposite colors
  - `analogous`: Colors within 60¬∞ of base hue
  - `triadic`: Three colors 120¬∞ apart
  - `random`: Random colors within variation range
- **color_variation** (0-100): Control how much colors vary from base
  - 0 = uniform color
  - 100 = maximum variation
  - Default: 30

#### New Parameters - Organic Variation
- **organic_factor** (0-1): Add controlled randomness and imperfection
  - 0 = perfect mathematical patterns (default)
  - 1 = highly organic, natural-looking
  - Effects:
    - Spirals: wobble, radius variation, position jitter
    - Waves: phase shifts, offset variation, jitter
    - Lissajous: parameter variation, jitter
    - Fractal Trees: random angles, 2-4 branches, asymmetric growth
    - Circle Packing: radius variation, organic clustering
- **completeness** (0.3-1.0): Control how complete the pattern is
  - 1.0 = full pattern (default)
  - 0.3 = only 30% drawn
  - Creates partial/incomplete aesthetics
  - For trees: randomly skips branches

#### Technical Improvements
- **Proper HSV color system**: Accurate RGB ‚Üî HSV conversion
- **Enhanced color manipulation**: Independent hue, saturation, value control
- **Pattern-specific organic variation**: Each pattern type has tailored randomness
- **Variable branch counts**: Fractal trees now generate 2-4 branches (not fixed at 2)
- **Backward compatible**: All new parameters have sensible defaults

#### User Experience
- **More interesting patterns**: Less regular, more organic feel
- **Greater creative control**: Fine-tune randomness and color schemes
- **Partial patterns**: Create sketch-like, incomplete aesthetics
- **Rich color options**: 6 different color distribution schemes
