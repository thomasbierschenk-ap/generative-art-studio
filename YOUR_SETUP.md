# Your Python Setup - Analysis

## üéâ **Good News: Everything Already Works!**

You don't need to install anything. Your system already has all the required packages installed globally, and **the code works perfectly right now**.

## Your Current Setup

### Python Installation
- **Python Version**: 3.9.6 (Apple's system Python)
- **Location**: `/usr/bin/python3`
- **pip Version**: 21.2.4

### Package Management Tools

You have **two** package management systems:

#### 1. **pipx** (for CLI tools)
- **Purpose**: Installs command-line tools in isolated environments
- **Location**: `~/Library/Application Support/pipx/venvs/`
- **Tools installed via pipx**:
  - `black` (code formatter)
  - `cookiecutter` (project templates)
  - `flake8` (linter)
  - `isort` (import sorter)
  - `notebooks` (Jupyter)
  - `poetry` (dependency manager)
  - `ruff` (fast linter)

#### 2. **uv** (modern package manager)
- **Version**: 0.9.5
- **Location**: `~/.local/bin/uv`
- **Purpose**: Fast Python package installer (Rust-based, replaces pip)
- **Tools installed via uv**:
  - `copier` (project templating)

### Your ~/.zshrc Configuration

```bash
# Adding pipx to path
export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
export PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=python3.10
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3/libexec/bin
```

**Note**: You have `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=python3.10` set, but you're using Python 3.9.6. This might cause issues if you try to install new pipx tools.

### Global pip Configuration

**File**: `~/.config/pip/pip.conf`
```ini
[global]
cert = /opt/homebrew/etc/openssl@1.1/cert.pem
index-url = https://artifactory.global.square/artifactory/api/pypi/block-pypi/simple
```

This is why you were having SSL issues - all pip installs go through Square's Artifactory.

## Required Packages Status

‚úÖ **All packages are already installed globally!**

```bash
$ python3 -c "import PIL; print('Pillow:', PIL.__version__)"
Pillow: 11.3.0

$ python3 -c "import svgwrite; print('svgwrite:', svgwrite.__version__)"
svgwrite: 1.4.3

$ python3 -c "import numpy; print('numpy:', numpy.__version__)"
numpy: 2.0.2
```

## How to Use the Generative Art Studio

### Option 1: Use System Python (Recommended - No Setup Needed!)

```bash
cd ~/goose_code/generative-art-studio

# Just run it - no venv needed!
python3 test_generator.py

# Run tests
python3 tests/test_random_walk.py

# Try the GUI (may not work due to Tkinter version)
python3 src/main.py
```

**Why this works**: The packages are already installed globally on your system.

### Option 2: Use uv (If You Want Isolation)

Since you have `uv` installed:

```bash
cd ~/goose_code/generative-art-studio

# Create a uv project (uses pyproject.toml)
uv venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate

# The packages are already available globally, but if you want them in the venv:
# (This will still hit the Square SSL issue though)
uv pip install Pillow svgwrite numpy
```

### Option 3: Use venv (Traditional)

```bash
cd ~/goose_code/generative-art-studio

# Create venv with access to system packages
python3 -m venv venv --system-site-packages

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# The packages are already available!
python3 test_generator.py
```

## Recommendations

### For This Project: Use System Python

Since all required packages are already installed globally, **you don't need a venv at all**. Just run:

```bash
cd ~/goose_code/generative-art-studio
python3 test_generator.py
python3 tests/test_random_walk.py
```

### For Future Projects

**Use `uv` for new projects** - it's much faster than pip:

```bash
# Create a new project
uv init my-project
cd my-project

# Add dependencies
uv add pillow svgwrite numpy

# Run your code
uv run python script.py
```

**Use `pipx` for CLI tools** - keeps them isolated:

```bash
# Install a CLI tool
pipx install some-cli-tool

# It's automatically available in your PATH
some-cli-tool --help
```

### Fix the Square SSL Issue (For Future Installs)

If you need to install packages in the future, you have two options:

**Option 1: Use a different network**
```bash
# At home or on phone hotspot
pip install package-name
```

**Option 2: Temporarily override pip config**
```bash
# Use public PyPI instead of Artifactory
pip install --index-url https://pypi.org/simple \
    --trusted-host pypi.org \
    --trusted-host pypi.python.org \
    --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org \
    package-name
```

## Summary

‚úÖ **Your setup is actually quite sophisticated!**
- You have `pipx` for isolated CLI tools
- You have `uv` for fast package management
- You have global packages already installed
- The generative art code works right now without any setup

‚ùå **The only issue:**
- Square's Artifactory SSL inspection breaks new package installations
- But you don't need to install anything for this project!

## Test It Now

```bash
cd ~/goose_code/generative-art-studio
python3 test_generator.py
ls -lh output/
open output/test_output.svg
```

You should see freshly generated artwork! üé®
