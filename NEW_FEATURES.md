# New Features - Progress Tracking & Control

## Overview

The GUI now includes enhanced progress tracking and control features that give you better visibility into the generation process and more control over it.

## What's New

### 1. Progress Indicator with Time Estimation

The progress section now shows:
- **Current Progress**: Percentage of completion (e.g., "45%")
- **Time Remaining**: Dynamically calculated estimate (e.g., "Est. time remaining: 2m 15s")
- **Smart Formatting**: 
  - Under 1 minute: Shows seconds (e.g., "15s")
  - Under 1 hour: Shows minutes and seconds (e.g., "2m 15s")
  - Over 1 hour: Shows hours and minutes (e.g., "1h 23m")
- **Completion Time**: When finished, shows total time taken (e.g., "Generation complete! (took 3.2s)")

### 2. Abort Button

Stop generation at any time:
- **Location**: Next to the Clear Canvas button, below Generate
- **Behavior**: 
  - Enabled only during generation
  - Click to immediately stop the current generation
  - Gracefully handles cleanup
  - Shows "Generation aborted by user" status message
- **Use Cases**:
  - Accidentally started with wrong parameters
  - Generation taking longer than expected
  - Want to try different settings

### 3. Clear Canvas Button

Reset your workspace:
- **Location**: Next to the Abort button
- **Behavior**:
  - Clears the preview canvas
  - Resets artwork data
  - Disables save buttons
  - Shows "Canvas cleared" status
- **Use Cases**:
  - Start fresh with a clean slate
  - Remove previous artwork before generating new one
  - Clear the workspace after saving

## How It Works

### Time Estimation Algorithm

The time estimation is calculated dynamically:

```
elapsed_time = current_time - start_time
progress_ratio = current_progress / 100
total_estimated_time = elapsed_time / progress_ratio
remaining_time = total_estimated_time - elapsed_time
```

This means:
- Estimates become more accurate as generation progresses
- Early estimates may fluctuate
- By 20-30% progress, estimates are usually reliable

### Abort Mechanism

The abort feature uses a thread-safe flag:
1. User clicks "Abort" button
2. `abort_generation` flag is set to `True`
3. Progress callback checks flag on each update
4. If flag is set, raises `InterruptedError`
5. Exception is caught and handled gracefully
6. UI is reset to ready state

### Button States

Buttons are intelligently enabled/disabled:

| Button | Ready | Generating | Complete | Aborted |
|--------|-------|------------|----------|---------|
| Generate | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Abort | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Clear Canvas | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Save PNG | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Save SVG | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |

## UI Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Generate]                          │
│ [Abort] [Clear Canvas]              │
│ [Save as PNG]                       │
│ [Save as SVG]                       │
│                                     │
│ ┌─ Progress ─────────────────────┐ │
│ │ [████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 45%  │ │
│ │ 45% - Est. time remaining: 2m  │ │
│ └────────────────────────────────┘ │
│                                     │
│ Status: Generating...               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Generation
```
0% - Est. time remaining: calculating...
25% - Est. time remaining: 3s
50% - Est. time remaining: 2s
75% - Est. time remaining: 1s
100% - Complete
Status: Generation complete! (took 4.2s)
```

### Example 2: Long Generation
```
0% - Est. time remaining: calculating...
10% - Est. time remaining: 5m 30s
25% - Est. time remaining: 4m 15s
50% - Est. time remaining: 2m 10s
75% - Est. time remaining: 1m 5s
100% - Complete
Status: Generation complete! (took 4m 20s)
```

### Example 3: Aborted Generation
```
0% - Est. time remaining: calculating...
15% - Est. time remaining: 8m 45s
[User clicks Abort]
Status: Aborting...
Status: Generation aborted by user
Progress: Aborted
```

## Technical Details

### Thread Safety

All UI updates are performed on the main thread using `root.after()`:
```python
self.root.after(0, lambda: self.progress_var.set(progress))
self.root.after(0, lambda: self.progress_info_var.set(progress_text))
```

### State Management

The GUI maintains several state variables:
- `is_generating`: Boolean flag for generation in progress
- `abort_generation`: Boolean flag for abort request
- `generation_start_time`: Timestamp when generation started
- `current_artwork`: The artwork being generated

### Error Handling

The abort mechanism uses exception handling:
```python
try:
    # Generation code
    if self.abort_generation:
        raise InterruptedError("Generation aborted by user")
except Exception as e:
    # Handle error or abort
    if "aborted" in str(e).lower():
        # Show abort message
    else:
        # Show error dialog
```

## Tips

### For Accurate Time Estimates
- Let generation run for at least 10-20% before relying on estimates
- Complex generations (many walks, many steps) have more accurate estimates
- Simple generations may complete before estimates stabilize

### When to Abort
- If estimated time is much longer than expected
- If you notice parameter mistakes early in generation
- If you want to try different settings quickly

### Using Clear Canvas
- Clear before generating if you want to see just the new artwork
- Keep previous artwork visible to compare with new parameters
- Clear after saving to free up memory

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Pause/Resume functionality
- Progress history graph
- Estimated vs actual time tracking
- Save progress snapshots
- Resume from last checkpoint
